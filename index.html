          Hi, I'm Mark! I'm a front-end engineer living in Arizona. With my 5
          years of programming experience using tools ranging from React, Vue,
          TypeScript, NodeJS, Redux, Vuex, and React Native I am equipped for
          your next project. Let's chat to discuss how I can create your next
          website or app with clean, pixel-perfect design.

          <h2>Soccer Standings</h2>
          <p>
            A Create React App project that makes use of React Router, Firebase,
            and cron jobs to scrape and display the latest tables for the top 5
            soccer leagues in the world. Created as a passion project to analyze
            team data across matchdays, this has been an ongoing project with
            incremental improvements. Initially I set up an "admin" dashboard to
            manually input all the soccer score, but I quickly grew weary of
            this process and set up a scraping service that runs every 15
            minutes on a cron job.

          <h2>ISS Tracer</h2>
          <p>
            My first React Native project, inspired by my daughter's interest in
            the International Space Station. Weary of using poorly designed
            websites on my phone to find the current position of the ISS, so I
            took on tracking the ISS as my first React Native project. I made
            use of the Mapbox SDK and the Open Notify API to plot the ISS and
            live update its location. Released to the Google Play store.

          <h2>The Road to 50 States</h2>
          <p>
            A React project I created as a gift to my dad when he was preparing
            to run a marathon in his 50th state -- Montana. The website served
            to both tell the story of my dad's journey to reaching his 50th
            state and also gave his family and friends a place to say their
            congratulations. I used Firestore as a quick and easy way to store
            all the user provided content (comments, photos, and videos).
